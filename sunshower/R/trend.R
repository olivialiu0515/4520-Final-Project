#' Estimate temperature trends for a specific station
#'
#' This function models the temperature trend and seasonal variations at a specific weather station
#' using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The model includes a linear trend component for the
#' year and a smooth seasonal component for the day of the year.
#'
#' @param station_id The identifier for the weather station, which could be numeric or string.
#' @return A dataframe with columns for year, day_of_year, and predicted_temp. The predicted_temp
#'         column contains the estimated average daily temperatures for each day of the year across
#'         the specified range of years.
#' @examples
#' # Estimate temperature trends for station 53878
#â€˜ data("all_data")
#' trends <- estimate_temp_trend(53878)
#' print(trends)
