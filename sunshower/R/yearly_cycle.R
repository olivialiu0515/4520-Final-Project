#' Estimate the yearly temperature cycle for a specific station and year
#'
#' This function estimates the annual cycle of daily mean temperatures for a specified weather
#' station and year using a non-linear least squares (nls) model. It fits a cosine and sine
#' function to the day of the year to capture seasonal temperature variations.
#'
#' @param station_id A numeric or string identifier for the weather station.
#' @param year The year for which the temperature cycle is to be estimated.
#' @return A dataframe with two columns: day_of_year and expected_temp, where
#'         day_of_year ranges from 1 to the number of days in the provided year, and
#'         expected_temp contains the predicted temperatures for these days.
#' @examples
#' # Estimate the temperature cycle for station 12345 in the year 2023
#' yearly_cycle <- estimate_yearly_cycle(12345, "2023")
#' plot(yearly_cycle$day_of_year, yearly_cycle$expected_temp, type = "l",
#'      main = "Estimated Yearly Temperature Cycle",
#'      xlab = "Day of the Year", ylab = "Temperature (Â°C)")
