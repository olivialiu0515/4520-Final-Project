\title{Estimate the yearly temperature cycle for a specific station and year}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.table} (inherits from \code{data.frame}) with 1134352 rows and 13 columns.
}
\usage{
df
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{A numeric or string identifier for the weather station.}

\item{year}{The year for which the temperature cycle is to be estimated.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns: day_of_year and expected_temp, where
        day_of_year ranges from 1 to the number of days in the provided year, and
        expected_temp contains the predicted temperatures for these days.
}
\description{
This function estimates the annual cycle of daily mean temperatures for a specified weather
station and year using a non-linear least squares (nls) model. It fits a cosine and sine
function to the day of the year to capture seasonal temperature variations.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'all_data' is a predefined dataframe with columns WBANNO, LST_DATE, and T_DAILY_MEAN
df <- all_data
# Estimate the temperature cycle for station 12345 in the year 2023
yearly_cycle <- estimate_yearly_cycle(12345, "2023")
plot(yearly_cycle$day_of_year, yearly_cycle$expected_temp, type = "l",
     main = "Estimated Yearly Temperature Cycle",
     xlab = "Day of the Year", ylab = "Temperature (Â°C)")
