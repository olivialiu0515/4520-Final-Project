\title{Estimate temperature trends for a specific station}
\usage{
estimate_temp_trend(station_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{station_id}{The identifier for the weather station, which could be numeric or string.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with columns for year, day_of_year, and predicted_temp. The predicted_temp
        column contains the estimated average daily temperatures for each day of the year across
        the specified range of years.
}
\description{
This function models the temperature trend and seasonal variations at a specific weather station
using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The model includes a linear trend component for the
year and a smooth seasonal component for the day of the year.
}
\examples{
# Estimate temperature trends for station 12345
trends <- estimate_temp_trend(12345)
plot(trends$day_of_year, trends$predicted_temp, type = "l",
     main = "Predicted Temperature Trends",
     xlab = "Day of the Year", ylab = "Predicted Temperature (Â°C)")
